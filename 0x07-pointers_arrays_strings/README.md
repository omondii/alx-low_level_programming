More pointers, strings and arrays.
The learning objectives for this Repo are
- What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
- Multidimensional arrays and how to use them
- C libraries used to manipulate strings. At Alx, we build this libraries from scratch.
FILE STRUCTURE.
|File|  ==  |Function|

1. |0-memset.c| == |A function that fills memory with a constant byte. Similar to `memeset` in standard library|
2. |1-memcpy.c| == |A function that copies memory area. Similar to `memcpy` in the standard library|
3. |2-strchr.c|  ==  |A function that locates a character in  astring. Similar to `strchr` function in std library|
4. |3-strspn.c|  ==  |A function that gets the length of a prefix substring. Similar to `strspn` in standard library|
5. |4-strpbrk.c|  ==  |A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. Similar to `strpbrk` in standard memory|
6. |5-strstr.c|  ==  |Locates a substring. Similar to strstrin memory|
7. |7-print_chessboard.c|  ==  |A function that prints the chessboard|
8. |8-print_diagsums.c|  ==  |A function that prints the sum of two diagonals of a square matrix of intergers|
